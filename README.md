# TGS
TGS stands for 'Time-varying Gene regulatory networks with Shortlisted candidate regulators'.

# Description: 
This package provides an implementation of the TGS algorithm and its 
variant named TGS-plus (TGS+). Each of these algorithms reconstructs 
time-varying gene regulatory networks from time-series gene 
expression datasets.   

For algorithmic details, please refer to: 
Saptarshi Pyne, Alok Ranjan Kumar, and Ashish Anand. Rapid 
reconstruction of time-varying gene regulatory networks. 
IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and 
Bioinformatics, 17(1):278--291, Jan--Feb 2020.  

For using these algorithms to process your time-series gene 
expressions, kindly see the manual entry for `TGS::LearnTgs()`.

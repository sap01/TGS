Title: Rapid Reconstruction of Time-Varying Gene Regulatory Networks
Description: Rapid advancements in high-throughput gene sequencing
    technologies have resulted in genome-scale time-series datasets. 
    Uncovering the underlying temporal sequence of gene regulatory events 
    in the form of time-varying gene regulatory networks demands 
    accurate and computationally efficient algorithms. Such an
    algorithm is 'TGS'. It is proposed in Saptarshi Pyne, Alok Ranjan 
    Kumar, and Ashish Anand; Rapid reconstruction of time-varying 
    gene regulatory networks; IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational 
    Biology and Bioinformatics, 17(1):278{291, Jan-Feb 2020. The TGS 
    algorithm is shown to consume only 29 minutes for a microarray 
    dataset with 4028 genes. This package provides an implementation 
    of the TGS algorithm and its variants.

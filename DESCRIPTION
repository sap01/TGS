Title: Rapid Reconstruction of Time-Varying Gene Regulatory Networks
Description: Rapid advancement in high-throughput gene expression measurement
    technologies has resulted in genome-scale time-series datasets. 
    Uncovering the underlying temporal sequence of gene regulatory events 
    in the form of time-varying Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) demands 
    computationally fast, accurate and highly scalable algorithms. Such an
    algorithm, namely TGS is proposed in Pyne et al., 2018 
    <doi:10.1109/TCBB.2018.2861698>). The TGS algorithm is shown to consume 
    only 29 minutes for a microarray dataset with 4028 genes. This package
    provides an implementation of the TGS algorithm.
